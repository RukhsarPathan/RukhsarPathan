#HEADING1

🎨 UI-Focused Frontend Developer | 🚀 SWE Intern @Meeedly  | 💻 Software Engineering Student @WGU

I’m passionate about turning designs into intuitive, beautiful interfaces that blend creativity with clean engineering. Currently, I’m pursuing my B.S. in Software Engineering at WGU while interning at Meeedly — the largest enterprise B2B meeting-scheduling platform, trusted in over 68 countries.

With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and UX/UI principles, I build modern, visually engaging interfaces that balance aesthetics and functionality.
