Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student at WGU with expected graduation in Dec-2025, with a passion for UI-focused frontend development, where design meets code to create seamless, user-friendly experiences.

With expertise in HTML, CSS and UX/UI principles. Currently diving into JavaScript, React. I enjoy building intuitive, visually engaging interfaces that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality. I also have hands-on experience with Python, Git, GitHub, GitLab, and AWS Cloud, ensuring my solutions are scalable, efficient, and well-managed.

Beyond my technical skills, I bring 8+ years of experience in customer-centric roles within financial services, allowing me to deeply understand user needs, problem-solving, and business impact.

ðŸš€ Currently seeking fully remote internships for Summer 2025 in Frontend Development, Software Engineering, or UI Engineering, where I can contribute my skills, collaborate with innovative teams, and refine my expertise. My expected graduation date is in Dec-2025!
